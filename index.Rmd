## Data Wrangling, Exploration, Visualization

### Yuxuan Zhuang yz24574

#### Introduction 

Paragraph or two introducing your datasets and variables, why they are interesting to you, etc.

```{R}
# read your datasets in here, e.g., with read_csv()

```

#### Tidying: Reshaping

If your datasets are tidy already, demonstrate that you can reshape data with pivot wider/longer here (e.g., untidy and then retidy). Alternatively, it may be easier to wait until the wrangling section so you can reshape your summary statistics. Note here if you are going to do this.

```{R}
# your tidying code (if applicable; can also wait until wrangling section)
```

    
#### Joining/Merging
